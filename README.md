# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk



## Overview

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this project different techniques were used to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Utilizing various libraries and algorithms to build and evaluate models using resampling including:

   mbalanced-learn
   
   scikit-learn
   
   RandomOverSampler
   
   SMOTE algorithms
   
   ClusterCentroids algorithm
   
   SMOTEENN algorithm
   
   BalancedRandomForestClassifier (bias reduction model)
   
   EasyEnsembleClassifier (bias reduction model)
